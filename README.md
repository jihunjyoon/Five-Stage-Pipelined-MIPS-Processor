# Five-Stage-Pipelined-MIPS-Processor
A five-stage pipelined MIPS processor built using VHDL, Assembly, and Modelsim.
​Project Overview:
Using Intel Quartus Prime, I worked with a partner to build a five-stage pipelined processor that would execute 6 standard MIPS instructions: ADD, ADDI, LW, SW, BEQ, and J. We designed components of the processor using VHDL, wired the components together in a block design file, and simulated the project using ModelSim.

Learned Skills:
Pipelined MIPS architecture including forwarding and hazard detection
Assembly language
VHDL language
How to simulate and debug using ModelSim

Resources Used:
Intel Quartus Prime
ModelSim
​
For CPRE 381 - Computer Organization and Assembly Level Programming
